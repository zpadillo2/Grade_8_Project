# Project Title: Study Buddy
## Project Description
This is a Python program that aims to calculate a students grade in both individual subjects and his/her GWA (General Weighted Average) and provide assisstance in subjects the user requests assisstance in by providing access to local text files
## Features
- Lets the user enter his/her grade level
- Lets the user input a specific subject
- Lets the user customize the number of assessments per subject
- Estimates the required score for the next assessment
- Calculate Grade (based on the PSHSS Grading System)
- Lets the user decide Grade Targets for either a quarter or the whole academic year
- Asks the user if they require assisstance in any subject and provides local text files for review
- Correctly handles user input error
## How to Run the Program
1. Install a python compiler
2. Download the files for the code project
3. Open terminal
4. Run the file by pressing "run"
5. Allow yourself to be guided by the instructions.

## Example Output
Enter your name: Marcus
Enter Grade level: 8
Enter GWA: 1.01
Enter Target Grade: 1.0
Target grade for the quarter or for the year?: quarter
Enter number of Formatitive assessments: 1
Enter number of Summative assessments: 3
Enter out of how much is your Formative assessment: 10
Enter total of all summatives: 100 
Enter score for Formatives: 10
Enter score for Summatives: 100 
Your grade this quarter: 1.0 (You have reached your goal)
