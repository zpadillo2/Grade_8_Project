I. Project Title
    Study Buddy
    II. Problem Statement
      Many students nowadays often forget or disregard their academic standing. This can be due to many reasons
      such as lack of study material resources or just purely not keeping track. This project aims to solve that
      by providing a reliable way to constantly keep ourselvesinformed of our grades and at the same time provide 
      resources to help either maintaining or improving our standing
III. Project Objectives
      - Provide a customizable, reliable, academic tracker that can take in multiple factors such as formative and
        summative assessments and calculate your grade. It hopefully will also be able to estimate a score required
        to meet the grade you want
      - Be able to provide reliable sources sourced from files on one’s computer and be able to sort out relevant 
        information 
IV. Planned Features
      - A customizable per subject academic tracker in which the user can input the number of activities and their
        scores, calculate their grade using the standard PSHS Grading System of the new curriculum, be able to input
        a target grade which will help the program analyze the minimum required score per assessment needed to achieve
        that grade
      - A “study buddy” which would be recommended to the user in the situation where the grade is substandard. It can 
        also be accessed upon the users request and be accessed through specific computer folders
  V. Planned Inputs and Outputs
      Inputs: Subject, Quarter, Previous Grade, Target Grade, Assessments, Assessment Scores
      Outputs: Quarter Grade (Final Grade in case 4th Quarter), Target Score per Assessment, Study Guide (if accessed by the user or substandard quarter grade)
