I. Project Title
    Study Buddy
    II. Problem Statement
      Many students nowadays often forget or disregard their academic standing. This can be due to many reasons
      such as lack of study material resources or just purely not keeping track. This project aims to solve that
      by providing a reliable way to constantly keep ourselvesinformed of our grades and at the same time provide 
      resources to help either maintaining or improving our standing
III. Project Objectives (SMART OBJECTIVES)
     Specific: Get students grades up while helping them learn
     Measurable: Project success measured via the grades on the card
     Attainable: This project is attainable via inspiration from similar systems to help code
     Relevant: Connected to the larger goal of increasing the average grade of students
     Time-Bounded: Target Completion by April-May, 2026
IV. Planned Features
      Study Buddy: An academic tracker with multiple customizable options (e.g. grade track play (quarter or year), subject or overall (subject is selectable),
                   target grade, grade display (in the 1.0-5.0 format or 60-100?), and assessment numbers (how many summative and formative assessments available and their scores)
      AI Helper: Used eitheer when requested by the user or if the user has a substandard grade and is used to help the user better understand the lesson
  V. Planned Inputs and Outputs
      Inputs: Subject, Quarter, Previous Grade, Target Grade, Assessments, Assessment Scores
      Outputs: Quarter Grade (Final Grade in case 4th Quarter), Target Score per Assessment, Study Guide (if accessed by the user or substandard quarter grade)
